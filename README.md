# This code implements a simple Caesar cipher for text encryption and decryption.
# It shifts letters by a specified value while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
# The user can choose to encrypt or decrypt a message based on their input.
# The code handles both uppercase and lowercase letters correctly.
# It also provides a basic user interface for inputting the message and shift value.
